                Drive-By Debug is a command line tool that attaches to a jvm
                like a normal debugger, but when pausing on breakpoints, 
                rather than making the user click around
                a graphical debugger gui, it will evaluate a set of expressions
                from a dynamically reloaded configuration file and then
                immediately resume the jvm, logging collected results.

                    <li>
                Some applications behave differently when timing changes because the debugger
                has paused on break points. Just collecting values and then resuming minimizes
                these effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes it is convenient to check the same set of values at the same point in the
                    code for different invocations. Logging the values separately avoids the tedium
                    of manually tabulating results. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes it is not practical or possible to connect a graphical debugger to 
                    a remote machine where a jvm is running. A command line utility installable
                    on the remote host can be more convenient.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    If a behaviour that needs to be investigated by debugging occurs on a 
                    production server then connecting a graphical debugger and pausing it may
                     not be possible.
                    Collecting values using Drive-By Debug just may be.
