                Drive-By Debug is a command line tool that attaches to a jvm
                like a normal debugger, and pauses on breakpoints like a normal debugger.
                With a normal debugger a user would then click around
                a graphical gui to find the variable values of interest. With Drive-by Debug,
                the variables are configured in advance so when the jvm pauses the relevant values
                are immediately recorded and then the jvm is resumed as fast as possible.

                Some applications behave differently when timing changes because the debugger
                has paused on break points. Timeouts can fire, connections can be lost.
                Just collecting values and then resuming minimizes
                these effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes it is convenient to check the same set of values at the same point in the
                    code for different invocations. Logging the values separately avoids the tedium
                    of manually tabulating results. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes it is not practical or possible to connect a graphical debugger to 
                    a remote machine where a jvm is running. A command line utility installable
                    on the remote host can be more convenient.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    If a behaviour that needs to be investigated by debugging occurs on a 
                    production server then connecting a graphical debugger and pausing it may
                     not be possible.
                    Collecting values on the fly with minimal pauses just may be.

                    It needs to be <a href="#install">downloaded</a>; then you need to write 
                     a small <a href="#configuration_format">configuration file</a>.

                    The configuration essentially just needs to specify <a href="#connector_config">where to attach</a>, <a href="#break">where in the code to break</a>
                    and <a href="#eval">what variables to record there</a> and finally

                    The target application, i.e. the application that you want to debug, needs to be started
                    with <a href="#attaching">standard debug parameters</a>.

                    When the target is <a href="#target_is_listening">up and listening</a> you can

                        You can clone the repository and build it yourself or download the latest release.
                        The resulting executable jar file is self-contained and can be placed just anywhere
                        you like.
